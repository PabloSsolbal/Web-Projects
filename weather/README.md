# Weather Widget Application

This project is a weather widget application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on the user's location input.

## To-Do List

- Implement a feature to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units.
- Improve the user interface with more detailed weather information and additional weather icons.
- Add error handling for cases where the API request fails or the weather data is incomplete.
- Add caching mechanism to store weather data for previously searched cities and avoid redundant API requests.
