# Memory Game

This project is a kid games web app developed in JavaScript and Python. Initially, this project was a single memory game of emotions, but when I decided to make some changes, ideas started to come to mind and a games web app was born. Now it also has a hangman game, and in the future, I want to implement more games and more functionalities. The app has colors, sounds, and some effects, so enjoy the games.
